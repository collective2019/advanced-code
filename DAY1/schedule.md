# Schedule for DAY1 - 17th of August 2019

### Git and Github Review. (30 mins)

- `git clone`: clones (copies) a repository (folder) from github to your computer.

Now, after you copy the repository to your computer where you can access the files. You're probably going to start making some changes: like adding files, changing files (like adding code or changing it). After you're done, you're going to need to let github know that you want it to track your changes.

To track each single file on its own, you can use `git add file_name`.
To track ALL files at once, you can use `git add .`

Great! now, since git is tracking your files and changes, you will want to **commit** those changes. Committing in git means **saving** those changes.

With each commit, you need to leave a **message**. The message describes what changes were made in each file.

To commit your tracked files, you use the command: `git commit -m`.

**Important note**: It's best practice to commit each file on its own. So you'd track a single file and then commit it. You should only commit more than one file at once if changes are related to each other.
